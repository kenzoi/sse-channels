## Warning

Channels is not really supported yet despite the package name, if your case is simple enough you can try use the `Session` class,
but it's not intended to be a channel.

While a major version `1.0.0` is not released if you want to use this package lock by its minor version like this `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`.
